## AI Usage Documentation
AI tools were used to optimize the development process as follows:
- **ChatGPT**: Assisted in giving boiler plate for API's and for refreshing my memory regarding file structuring in Next Js app router. Also helping me in giving boilerplate for read.me. 
- **DeepSeek**: Helped me trobuleshooting in bugfixes in API routes regarding parameters error in getting expenses. Also helped me in getting deeper understanding of how supabase works by understading the examples given, and how it compares with firebase.
- **Supabase AI**: Helped me trobleshoot SQL qurries regading creating tables and policies.


## Video Demonstration
A walkthrough video showcasing the working application, Supabase database structure, and AI usage explanation is included in the submission.

## Notes

- The project adheres to the 4-5 hour time constraint.
- Supabase is the sole database and authentication provider used.
